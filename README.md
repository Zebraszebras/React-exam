- Next.js: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- CSS Modules: A CSS approach that locally scopes styles to prevent conflicts.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/travel-app.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`
